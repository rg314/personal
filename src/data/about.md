# Intro

I'm the founding engineer at [deepMirror.ai](https://deepmirror.ai/) and I'm passionate about designing efficient and scalable infrastructure to rapidly deliver AI solutions while minimizing technical debt. Alongside my PhD in Biophysics at the University of Cambridge, I have been involved with several start-ups and entrepreneurship programs at Cambridge Judge Business School.

I attained my undergraduate (MEng) in Material Science form the University of Manchester and went on to join the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (NanoDTC) program at Cambridge for my masters (MRes) and PhD. You can normally find he running around Hyde Park.
